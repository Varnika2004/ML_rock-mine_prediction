# ML_rock-mine_prediction
Welcome to the repository for the machine learning project focused on predicting whether an underwater object detected during enemy submarine attacks is a rock or a mine. The objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that aids in distinguishing between harmless rocks and potentially dangerous underwater mines.
